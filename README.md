# Installing dependencies

We will be using conda to build our environments.

The packages and versions are defined in env.yml. The command to install the environment will be:

```
conda env create -f env.yml
```

This will create an environment called DSC540.

Additional dependencies can be added. If conda does not have the package, then we can use pip to install it. Simply add the package name and version in the yaml entry for pip.
